How I got here

**Body text (Sofia Pro Regular, 18px, Warm Charcoal \#3D3633, line height 1.8):**

I didn’t come into this work through a traditional path, but it gave me a clear perspective on what most brands actually need. Content rarely fails because of creativity. It fails when strategy and positioning are unclear.

Clarion Studio is built on clarity before content. I work with founders to bring structure, direction, and intention to how their brand shows up online, so it reflects the substance of the business behind it

**Small handwritten note at bottom (Allura, 22px, Deep Terracotta):**

Based in Barcelona, working globally

How we work together

**Introduction (Sofia Pro Regular, 18px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.8):**

Working with me doesn't mean handing everything over and hoping for the best. 

It's collaborative. You stay involved, but you don't have to do the heavy lifting.

Here's what it actually looks like:

**Roadmap (clean visual structure with spacing):**

**Step 1**  
 **Headline (Meno Banner, 24px, Deep Terracotta):** We talk  
 **Body (Sofia Pro Regular, 17px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.7):**  
 A free 20-minute call where I ask questions about your business, your audience, and what's not working. No pitch. Just clarity on whether we're a fit.

**Step 2**  
 **Headline (Meno Banner, 24px, Deep Terracotta):** We define your foundation  
 **Body (Sofia Pro Regular, 17px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.7):**  
 If we move forward, we start with positioning. Who you serve, what transformation you offer, what makes you different. This becomes the anchor for everything we create.

**Step 3**  
 **Headline (Meno Banner, 24px, Deep Terracotta):** We build the strategy  
 **Body (Sofia Pro Regular, 17px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.7):**  
 Content pillars. Posting rhythm. Messaging frameworks. A 90-day plan that feels doable, not overwhelming.

**Step 4**  
 **Headline (Meno Banner, 24px, Deep Terracotta):** We execute (together or solo)  
 **Body (Sofia Pro Regular, 17px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.7):**  
 Depending on what you need, I either create the content for you, or teach you how to do it yourself with guidance. Either way, you're never left wondering what's next.

**Step 5**  
 **Headline (Meno Banner, 24px, Deep Terracotta):** We refine  
 **Body (Sofia Pro Regular, 17px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.7):**  
 We check in regularly, biweekly or monthly depending on the package. We look at what's working, what's not, and adjust. No rigid plans that ignore reality.

**Closing text (Sofia Pro Regular, 18px, Warm Charcoal, line height 1.8):**

It's simple. We talk, we plan, we create, we refine.

You stay in the loop without drowning in the details. I handle the strategy 

and execution. You approve and move forward.

**Small handwritten note (Allura, 24px, Deep Terracotta, slightly rotated 2-3 degrees):**

No disappearing after the kickoff call. I'm here throughout.
